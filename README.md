# XGBoosting with Python · Customer Feedback

**Context**

This activity is a continuation of the airline's churn rating project in which I built decision tree and random forest models. I will use the same data, but this time I will train, tune, and evaluate an XGBoost model. In addition, I’ll explore the feature importances of the model and identify the features that most contribute to customer satisfaction.

**Skills**

EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling  
Feature engineering for ML  
Building an XGBoosting machine (classification model)  
Tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV  
Evaluating an XGBoost model using metrics and interpreting results
